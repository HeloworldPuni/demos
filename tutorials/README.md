## ❓ FAQ

### Do I need to know how to code?
**No!** These tutorials are written for complete beginners. Just follow each step carefully.

**~$50 total**:
- Testnet deployment: FREE (using fake ETH)
- Mainnet deployment: ~$10 in gas fees
- Testing: ~$10 in real USDC
- Buffer: ~$30 for mistakes/extras

### Can I test everything for free first?
**Yes!** Tutorial 3 shows you how to deploy to Base Sepolia (testnet) first. This uses fake ETH and lets you test everything before using real money.

**Check**:
1. The "Common Issues" section in each tutorial

3. Google the error message
4. Ask for help (leave the error message in your question)

- Double-check all addresses before sending money
- Never share your seed phrase with anyone

### How long until the app is live?
**If everything goes smoothly**: 3-4 hours total work time, but spread over a few days to:
- Wait for account approvals
